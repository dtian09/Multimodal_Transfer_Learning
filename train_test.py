#training and testing the multimodal transformer model
#download the Flickr30k dataset from Hugging Face
#split the dataset into training and testing sets
#create training batches and testing batches 
#for each training epoch:
# split each image of the training set into patches
# project each patch into a vector
# pass the patches to the encoder
# pass the text descriptions to decoder
