#training and testing the multimodal transformer model
#download the Flickr30k dataset from Hugging Face
#split the dataset into training and testing sets
#create training batches and testing batches 
#for each training epoch:
# split each image of the training set into patches
# project each patch into a vector
# create embeddings of the vector
# pass the embeddings to the encoder
# insert <sos> to the image caption and pass the embeddings of the image captions to the decoder
# pass the output of the encoder and target image caption to the decoder
